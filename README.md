### Encrypt a Message

- Choose a 4-letter key made of W, A, S, D (for example, "WASD" or "ASWD").
- Click **Encrypt** to see your secret message.

### Decrypt a Message

- Paste the encrypted message (which ends with a `:KEY`, like `:WASD`) into the "Decrypt a Message" section.
- Click **Decrypt** to reveal the original message.

## Install as an App (Optional)

If you want, you can install the tool as an app on your device by using the install prompt in your browser (usually a plus sign + or "Install" option).

This way, you can use the cipher tool like a regular app, even offline!

## About This Project

- All the code was created with help from **ChatGPT** (an AI assistant by OpenAI).  
- I came up with the idea for the WASD Cipher Tool myself!  
- I don’t know how to code yet, so I worked with ChatGPT to make this project happen.
